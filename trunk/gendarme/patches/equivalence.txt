This document intends to be an equivalence between patches I will write and
revisions commited to mono subversion.

It's only for informative purposes.  And it will contain a reference to a patch
file and other for the revision, by example:

use_correct_stuff.patch -> r453212

The first operand shows the patch, and the second shows the revision where the
patch has been checked in.

--------------------------------------------

xsd_applyTo.patch -> r104124
applyTo_implementation.patch -> 104709

AvoidCallingProblematicMethodsRule -> r107128, r107129
